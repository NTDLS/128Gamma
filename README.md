# 128Gamma
128Gamma was the first encryption program which NetworkDLS attempted to market. It was crude, improperly written and unstable. Feel free to learn from the autopsy :face-palm:.

üóÉÔ∏è Keep in kind that this is a legacy utility, originally designed for Windows 95/98 and 2000 and is archived here for acedemic and historical purposes.

Because of the unconventional registry operations performed by the install process, we HIGHLY recommend that you only run this application on "throw-away" virtual machines.
