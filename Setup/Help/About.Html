<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>About NetWorkDLS</H3>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>Think of NetWorkDLS as a programmer's pen name.</P>

<P>NetWorkDLS is a name for myself. When I finish a program, NetWorkDLS
wrote it, not I. </P>

<P>NetWorkDLS is dedicated to offering high quality software. NetWorkDLS
will continue to offer high quality free software, but will charge small
amounts for large developments.</P>

<P>NetWorkDLS also looks to start offering web space in the near future.
For details and free software visit <A HREF="Http://NetWorkDLS.Com">NetWorkDLS.Com</A>.
