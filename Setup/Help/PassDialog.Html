<CENTER><P>The 128Gamma password dialog appears after you have selected
the files or folders you want to encrypt. The empty text box is where you
type the password you want to encrypt the file with. The password must
be at least 8 characters and no more than 56 characters. The password strength
status on this dialog tells you how strong the length of your password
is, the longer the password the safer the data. To make this dialog stay
on top of all other windows click the &quot;Top Most&quot; button. If you
want to compress the data you are encrypting you can click the &quot;Compress
Data&quot; button. If you want to delete the files you are encrypting and
keep only the encrypted data click the &quot;Delete Source&quot; Button.
Use the &quot;Delete Source&quot; button with caution. If you encrypt your
files, delete the source and lose your password, Your files are gone. NetWorkDLS
cannot help you retrieve your files.</P></CENTER>
