<CENTER><P>128Gamma Uses A 448-Bit BlowFish Algorithm</P></CENTER>

<P>Blowfish is a block cipher encryption algorithm that encrypts data in
8-byte blocks. The algorithm consists of two parts: A key-expansion part
and a data-encryption part.</P>

<P>Key expansion converts a variable-length key of at most 56 bytes (448
bits) into several subkey arrays totaling 4168 bytes.</P>

<P>Blowfish has 16 rounds. Each round consists of a key-dependent permutation,
and a key- and data-dependent substitution. All operations are XORs and
additions on 32-bit words. The only additional operations are four indexed
array data lookups per round.</P>

<P>No one has come close to developing an attack that breaks Blowfish.</P>

<P>Even so, more cryptanalysis is required before pronouncing the algorithm
secure. I invite others to continue analyzing the algorithm.</P>
