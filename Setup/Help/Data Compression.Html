<P>128Gamma supports data compression... This means that when you encrypt
or pack files they actually become smaller than they were before you encrypted
them. 128Gamma Data Compression is Off by default. To activate 128Gamma
Data Compression: when you are encryping and 128Gamma prompts you for a
password, click the button that says &quot;Compress Data&quot;.</P>

<P><B>Notes:</B></P>

<UL>
<LI>(1) 128Gamma Data Compression works on all type of files, Though you
will find that the compression ratio is much greater on text files.</LI>

<LI>(3) 128Gamma Data Compression is NOT compatible with WinZip.</LI>

<LI>(4) Windows NT &amp; 2000 will report that a file compressed by 128Gamma
is not compressed. This is because 128Gamma does not interact with Windows
NT &amp; 2000 built in compression methods. In most cases 128Gamma compresses
beyond the capabilities of Windows NT &amp; 2000.</LI>
