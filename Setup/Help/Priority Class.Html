<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>128Gamma PriorityClass</H3>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>128Gamma allows you to change the PriorityClass at which it executes.</P>

<P>The PriorityClass effects the entire program. All functions &amp; all
Threads in 128Gamma will be boosted to this PriorityClass.</P>

<P>Changing the PriorityClass will effect the entire operating system,
For example : Setting 128Gamma to High priority will block processor time
of programs that are running at a lower priority.</P>

<P>High And RealTime PriorityClass are not recomended. RealTime PriorityClass
Can easily cause the computer to stop responding if 128Gamma runs for more
than just a few seconds.</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="128Priority.jpg" HEIGHT=228 WIDTH=256></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P>The above utility was installed with 128Gamma and will be in
the start menu under the group 128Gamma was installed to. Default: <I>Start
&gt; Program &gt; 128Gamma</I></P></CENTER>

<P><B>(Idle)</B></P>

<P>Specify this class for a process whose threads run only when the system
is idle. The threads of the process are preempted by the threads of any
process running in a higher priority class. An example is a screen saver.
</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B>(Normal)</B></P>

<P>Specify this class for a process with no special scheduling needs. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B>(High)</B></P>

<P>Specify this class for a process that performs time-critical tasks that
must be executed immediately. The threads of the process preempt the threads
of normal or idle priority class processes. An example is Windows Task
List, which must respond quickly when called by the user, regardless of
the load on the operating system. Use extreme care when using the high-priority
class, because a high-priority class application can use nearly all available
CPU time. </P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P><B>(RealTime)</B></P>

<P>Specify this class for a process that has the highest possible priority.
The threads of the process preempt the threads of all other processes,
including operating system processes performing important tasks. For example,
a real-time process that executes for more than a very brief interval can
cause disk caches not to flush or cause the mouse to be unresponsive.</P>

<P>Note: PriorityClass &amp; ThreadPriority are not set untill 128Gamma
is actually writing to the file.</P>
